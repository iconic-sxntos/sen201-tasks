## Project Description
The Online Voting System is a simple console-based application developed using Python.
It allows users to vote for a candidate, view voting results, and end the voting process.

This project was developed as part of the SEN 201 course assignment and follows the
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).


## Features
- Display available candidates
- Cast a vote for a candidate
- Prevent invalid voting
- Display voting results


## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Platform: Console / Command Line


## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The system should allow users to vote, view results, and exit the system.

### 2. System Design
The system is designed using functions such as:
- display_candidates()
- cast_vote()
- display_results()

A dictionary data structure is used to store candidates and their votes.

### 3. Implementation
The system is implemented using Python with clear and well-structured functions.

### 4. Testing
The system was tested using valid and invalid inputs to ensure correctness.

### 5. Deployment
The application is deployed by uploading the source code to a GitHub repository.

### 6. Maintenance
Future improvements may include voter authentication, database storage, and a graphical interface.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run the program using:
Python 3
```bash
python online_voting_system.py
